#Power on Procedure

Turn on switch

## Connect the EeePC as an internet gateway 

Turn on EeePC, it acts as an internet gateway and NTP server. The Raspberry Pi's must have an accurate time source.
Run the script share_internet.sh on the EeePC
Open a web browser and visit a page, force it to reload by pressing Ctrl+F5 and go through the Guest Wifi's login process.

## Turn on the master node

Ensure the master node is connected to the switch. 
Ensure the monitor, keyboard and mouse are connected and that the monitor has power.
Plugin the master node and let it boot.
Check it has the correct time and date.
Check it can ping something on the internet
(if possible) plug in a second laptop to the switch and get an IP via DHCP. This machine should NOT get a default route or DNS from the DHCP server. 

## Turn on the worker nodes

Do this one bank of 3/4 nodes at a time to reduce NFS server load. Each bank should be on its own power bar. 
Plug in the first bank and allow it to boot, this will take a couple of minutes.
SSH into each node in turn, check that /home is mounted correctly, if there is a password prompt this is a sign that its not.
Check that the time and date are correct.
The node should appear in sinfo on the master listed in state "down" and not "down*" (which means it is unreachable).
Repeat for each bank of nodes
Once all nodes are booted run the script cluster_up.sh on the master, this should change the sinfo state to "idle"

## Running the Pi calculation Demo

Open a terminal
cd pi_cluster/mpi_pi_demo/gui
python3 gui.py

Open a file manager to the same directory to show output images


## Shutting down

(optional) drain the compute nodes with:
sudo scontrol update NodeName=worker[00-09] state=drain reason=Shutdown 

Run shutdown_cluster.sh to shutdown the compute nodes



power off each bank in turn
shutdown master
unplug it
